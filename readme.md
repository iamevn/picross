# Picross

Just playing around with picross and learning some javascript/css/html.
Eventually I'd like to extend this to Picross 3D style puzzles and write a
solver that doesn't just brute force the puzzle (if possible for the puzzle,
Picross in general is NP-complete)

I really like the UI on the Picross E series of games so I'm trying to base mine off of that.
